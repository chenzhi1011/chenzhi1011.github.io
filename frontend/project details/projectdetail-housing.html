            <p><strong>Design background: </strong></p>
            <p>This is a residential design project set against the backdrop of an aging population. The site is located
                in Fujian, China. With China's rapid development in recent years, many old residences have been
                demolished and replaced with newly built commercial housing, which often fails to meet the needs of
                elderly residents.</p>
            <p>This design aims to explore how the area should be reconstructed after demolition to better serve the
                local population.</p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>The chosen site features a fascinating spatial element—the roads.
                This area is interconnected by roads of various sizes, serving as connections not only in a spatial
                sense but also in terms of daily life. Each household engages in different activities along these roads,
                enhancing the sense of community and reducing feelings of isolation. Furthermore, these road networks do
                not exist independently but are formed organically, shaped by the surrounding buildings.</p>
            <p>Therefore, this design revolves around the concept of roads.</p>
